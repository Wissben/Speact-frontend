## Get the dependencies
Open your cloned folder. Then, using your favorite package manager get the dependencies

Example using npm

`npm install`

Example using yarn

`yarn`

## Start development server & build

Open your cloned folder. Then, using your favorite package manager run `dev` command

Example using npm

`npm run dev`

Example using yarn

`yarn dev`

When you done these steps, your default browser should open and redirect you to `localhost:8080`. If the port 8080 is already in use, you can give an `port` argument to connect at specified port

Example using npm

`npm run dev --port 9090`

Example using yarn

`yarn dev --port 9090`

**PLEASE DO NOT USE THE DEVELOPMENT SERVER FOR SERVING YOUR APP, DEVELOPMENT SERVER IS MEANT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT. INSTEAD PLEASE UPLOAD BUILD ARTIFACTS TO A STATIC WEB-SERVER**

## Building for production

Your app will be bundled to `dist/build.js`
To build it you can use npm or yarn

Example using npm

`npm run build`

Example using yarn

`yarn build`

## Customizing App & Connecting your agent

To connect your bot, you first need to create one. You can do it by visiting [Dialogflow website](https://dialogflow.com). Then create your intents and add Google Assistant responses

Open `config.js` and change the `token` variable, to connect your bot. You can also translate the strings to your language

Example

```js
export default {
    app: {
        token: "9d686a47b1de48bab431e94750d1cd87"
    }
}
```

if you want to change the accent color open `src/App.sass` and change the `$color` variable

## Frequently Asked Questions

- Q: I changed the token and the responses are the same as with previous token
- A: Make sure you have **cleaned your cache** and **rebuilt your app**. In Safari go to "Develop" > "Empty Caches". In Chrome: "Developer Tools" > "Application" > "Clear storage" > "Clear site data"
